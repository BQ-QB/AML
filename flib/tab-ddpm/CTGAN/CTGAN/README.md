## Implemented Models

Currently, this library implements the **CTGAN** and **TVAE** models proposed in the [Modeling Tabular data using Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503) paper. For more information about these models, please check out the respective user guides:
* [CTGAN User Guide](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/ctgan.html).
* [TVAE User Guide](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/tvae.html).

# Install

**CTGAN** is part of the **SDV** project and is automatically installed alongside it. For
details about this process please visit the [SDV Installation Guide](
https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html)

Optionally, **CTGAN** can also be installed as a standalone library using the following commands:

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
pip install ctgan
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
conda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge ctgan
```

For more installation options please visit the [CTGAN installation Guide](INSTALL.md)

# Usage Example

> :warning: **WARNING**: If you're just getting started with synthetic data, we recommend using the SDV library which provides user-friendly APIs for interacting with CTGAN. To learn more about using CTGAN through SDV, check out the user guide [here](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/ctgan.html).

To get started with CTGAN, you should prepare your data as either a `numpy.ndarray` or a `pandas.DataFrame` object with two types of columns:

* **Continuous Columns**: can contain any numerical value.
* **Discrete Columns**: contain a finite number values, whether these are string values or not.

In this example we load the [Adult Census Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) which is a built-in demo dataset. We then model it using the **CTGANSynthesizer** and generate a synthetic copy of it.


```python3
from ctgan import CTGANSynthesizer
from ctgan import load_demo

data = load_demo()

# Names of the columns that are discrete
discrete_columns = [
    'workclass',
    'education',
    'marital-status',
    'occupation',
    'relationship',
    'race',
    'sex',
    'native-country',
    'income'
]

ctgan = CTGANSynthesizer(epochs=10)
ctgan.fit(data, discrete_columns)

# Synthetic copy
samples = ctgan.sample(1000)
```

## R interface for CTGAN

A wrapper around **CTGAN** has been implemented by Kevin Kuo @kevinykuo, bringing the functionalities
of **CTGAN** to **R** users.

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* ðŸ”„ Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* ðŸ§  Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* ðŸ“Š Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.
